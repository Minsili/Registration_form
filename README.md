# Registration_form
Students registration form.
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScripts and Node.js for this project.
On this form, the student can enter his/her name, surname, Highest degree, and upload files (diploma file, transcript file and inscription demanad).
There's a language-switcher that we implemented with JS that makes the form switches from Engish to French.
We used Nodemailer to send the form data to a particular email.
We used MySQL database to store the user information in the users table in the registration db.
